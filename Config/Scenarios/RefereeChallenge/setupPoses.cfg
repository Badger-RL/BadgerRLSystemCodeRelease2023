// Position as defined in the latest version of the rule book:
// - One robot of the challenged team is placed in the center circle facing the head referee
// - The head referee must stand on the T-junction of the center field line, opposite to the GC.
// We assume that the robot plays from right to left (as seen from the GameController).
// There is only one robot, the number of the robot dows not matter. Thus, all five positions are the same.
